## About

This project demonstrates browser based testing using [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/).

This project contains a test against a feed reader application using the jasmine framework. It is mainly to help me practice Testing and gain confidence while working with any application.

## Getting Started
All the files needed for the work was already given .  You only have to complete the tests on the feedreader.js file.

Open `index.html` in the browser of your choice.
It may take some time to completely load as additional network requests are made.
Once loaded, test results should be displayed at the bottom of the page.

The online version can be seen at  https://nne85.github.io/Udacity-feedreader-Jasmine/.
